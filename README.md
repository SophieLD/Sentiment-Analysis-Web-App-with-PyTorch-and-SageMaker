# Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App-with-PyTorch-and-SageMaker
### <font color=gray>SageMaker Deployment Project</font>

This project is a part of the Udacity [Machine Leaning Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all). This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of the project is to use Pytorch funtionality in cloud service Amazonâ€™s SageMaker to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, train and test it, then deploy it, at the end use the deplyed model in a sentiment analysis web app which take in the any input review for movies and predict if the review is positive or negative.
